## Day 2 Report: "Psychedelics as Medicine" Conference

##### February 28, 2025

Written by Salvia Starling, Editor-in-Chief of iboga.org

### Introduction

The second day of the "Psychedelics as Medicine" conference on February 28, 2025 delivered a powerful mix of scientific breakthroughs, traditional wisdom, and practical applications that expanded significantly on Day 1's foundations. Beginning with Arnmundur Björnsson's musical invocation to "voice your truth" and closing with the Central Asian rhythms of Steppe Sons, the day created a full-spectrum exploration of psychedelic medicine's global scope.

The morning sessions featured Dr. Gül Dölen's groundbreaking research on how MDMA reopens critical periods in brain development – including surprising experiments with octopuses – alongside an international "Iboga Without Borders" panel that brought together practitioners from three continents. Representatives from Central and Southern Africa, Brazil, and Canada shared practical approaches to cultivation, treatment protocols, and cross-cultural collaboration, providing the iboga community with concrete models for sustainable practice.

Policy reform took center stage as Natalia Rebollo confronted colonialism in drug prohibition, while Ethan Nadelmann highlighted Scandinavia's potential leadership in psychedelic reform. Meanwhile, Tobias Erny presented new clinical evidence for iboga's remarkable effectiveness in treating Parkinson's disease at lower doses, and Leonard Pickard – the legendary "LSD King" who served 24 years in prison – offered profound reflections on psychedelic history and spiritual intention. Indigenous perspectives were powerfully represented by Biruany and Bixku Huni Kuin, who shared their Amazonian traditions and ongoing fight for cultural preservation.

For the iboga community specifically, Day 2 delivered actionable insights: from Bismark Dadzie's innovative integrated catfish-and-iboga farm system, to clinical protocols from Bruno Chaves Rasmussen, to concrete policy reform strategies that could expand therapeutic access while honoring traditional contexts.

### Iboga-Specific Content

#### Iboga Without Borders: A Global Perspective on Healing

One of the day's most relevant sessions for the iboga community brought together practitioners and experts from across the globe. Moderated by Simeon Schnapper, the panel featured Stephane Lasmé from Gabon, Bismark Dadzie from Ghana, Brazilian ibogaine doctor Bruno Chaves Rasmussen, Colin Kilty from PsyGen in Canada, and our very own iboga.org founder Sy Tzu (Simon Anderson) from South Africa.

Stephane Lasmé emphasized the importance of acknowledging legacy and the work of those who came before, drawing parallels to lessons learned in the cannabis industry. His vision involves bringing Gabonese technology and protocols into Western contexts while honoring their origins.

Bismark Dadzie shared innovative sustainability practices, describing how his tabernanthe farm uses integrated systems where the tank water from catfish (which are later sold as food) nourishes iboga plants—a beautiful example of ecological thinking applied to sacred medicine cultivation. He stressed the importance of respecting the plant when it's young and taking respectful care of the spiritual plant iboga.

Bruno Chaves Rasmussen, with over 30 years of experience treating thousands of patients with HCL ibogaine in Brazil, emphasized safety protocols and accessibility. He challenged common perceptions about ibogaine's dangers, stating, "Ibogaine is not as dangerous as people think," while advocating for treating it "like a small surgery" with appropriate care and screening.

Colin Kilty discussed GMP ibogaine production, while Simon Anderson used an orchestra metaphor to distinguish between iboga and ibogaine, noting that the isolated compound "misses the lower notes" present in the whole plant medicine. Colin expressed concern about the "pendulum swinging too far towards the pursuit of profits" which the panel agreed with, while calling for greater collaboration between traditional practitioners, clinicians, and researchers. Sy pointed out that, while the Bwiti are often talked about and even invited to conversations about iboga, the pygmies, the original iboga guardians, have never yet been invited to the table. 

A critical point emerged when I asked the panel a question around safety considerations in traditional Central African usage versus clinical usage. Panelists noted that early Western ibogaine use often involved treating individuals with compromised health from addiction, potentially explaining some adverse outcomes.

#### Treating Parkinson's Disease with Iboga

Tobias Erny presented his phenomenal work on iboga's applications beyond addiction treatment, specifically for Parkinson's disease. His research revealed that while flood doses proved ineffective for Parkinson's patients, smaller doses—mirroring how some traditional communities use iboga—showed promising results.

Erny provided a historical overview of research on ibogaine for Parkinson's and shared several success stories from his studies. However, he noted that results vary significantly, with 40-50% of patients showing no improvement. That fact did not detract from the wonder the audience experienced when we were shown a video of a patient who was severely disabled by late stage Parkinson’s, unable to stand or walk without assistance. The patient had received all possible treatments offered by mainstream medicine, including deep-brain stimulation. It was only after receiving ibogaine treatment that the patient could stand on his own, walk across the room, even reach out to grasp a door handle and open a door. I will tell you, readers - I cried watching this video! The change in the patient seemed miraculous. This presentation highlighted how iboga's therapeutic potential extends beyond addiction treatment into neurological disorders, potentially opening new avenues for research and application.

### Research Frontiers: Scientific Insights for Psychedelic Practice

#### Reopening Critical Periods with Psychedelics

Dr. Gül Dölen delivered a fascinating presentation on how psychedelics can reopen critical periods in brain development. Starting with comparative brain structures across species—including humans, mice, and octopuses—she emphasized the value of studying both similar and different brain types to understand psychedelic mechanisms.

Her research on MDMA's effects on octopuses revealed surprising social behaviors, with treated octopuses becoming more playful, relaxed, and seeking physical contact—behaviors highly unusual for these typically solitary creatures. This work challenged conventional explanations of how MDMA affects the brain, suggesting molecular-level actions beyond current understanding.

Dr. Dölen explained critical periods—specific windows of heightened learning capacity, such as language acquisition in humans or song learning in birds—and described psychedelics as a "master key" for reopening these periods. Importantly, she distinguished between different types of neuroplasticity, noting that while many drugs cause "hyperplasticity" (changes in the brain), psychedelics induce "metaplasticity"—a change in the brain's capacity to *produce* plasticity.

She emphasized the importance of context, stating, "You can't take MDMA and go to a rave and expect to cure your PTSD," advocating for structured therapeutic settings when using psychedelics as medicine. This sentiment was repeated by many speakers throughout the conference. The clear consensus is that the molecules don’t work in isolation; however, with the right intention, strong preparation and integration protocols, and a sacred space and setting, they can be profoundly transformative and healing.

#### The Future of MDMA and the FDA

Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS, discussed the current state of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. He challenged the notion that drug development necessarily costs billions, suggesting that new treatments could be funded for a few hundred million dollars when approached efficiently.

Doblin emphasized that the therapeutic context makes a critical difference in outcomes—a principle relevant to all psychedelic medicines, including iboga. He noted the regulatory challenge that the FDA cannot approve therapies directly, leading pharmaceutical companies to divorce drugs from their accompanying therapeutic protocols, potentially reducing effectiveness. This was another sentiment repeated throughout the weekend, with several people expressing frustration at the FDA systems which don’t allow for approval of therapies, resulting in poor outcomes in testing because, as we’ve previously established, the molecules don’t work anywhere near as well in isolation. 

### Cultural & Ethical Considerations

#### Indigenous Wisdom from the Huni Kuin

Biruany and Bixku Huni Kuin, accompanied by interpreter Louisa, shared insights from their Amazonian tradition. They described their struggle to preserve cultural practices despite colonization, having been forced to hide in forests to maintain their traditions and medicinal knowledge.

Biruany highlighted the significant achievement of women now serving as medicine carriers—a role historically limited to men in their culture. Both speakers emphasized the interconnectedness of all life, noting there is no word for "nature" in their language because they don't see themselves as separate from it. "We are never separated," they explained, describing the forest as "a living pharmacy."

Their message resonated with many principles recognized in iboga traditions—the importance of intention, guided practice, community support, and the understanding that these medicines "didn't just come through for the tribe, but all humanity." They closed their presentation by including everyone present in a ceremony song, bringing the audience into direct experience of their tradition.

#### Queer Medicine: How Psychedelics Can Heal the Trauma of Normal

Justin Natoli presented a unique perspective on how normative structures create trauma by forcing conformity. Beginning with a story  which showed how humans divorced themselves from their metaphorical queerness early on, moving communities away from the importance of kin into the policing of sin. Natoli explained how suppressing our authentic expression disconnects us from wisdom and divinity. He introduced the beautiful idea of incorporating queer archetypal energy when we’re having conversations about masculine and feminine archetypes.

"Our bodies and our hearts are direct sources of wisdom and our connection to the divine, and if we're taught that's wrong, we'll turn to external authorities," he noted. Natoli introduced the concept of "normative trauma" as that which "shackles our imagination" and "restricts our capacity to imagine the full spectrum of human love, connection, and expression."

His central message—"You are the medicine"—echoed themes found in traditional iboga practices where personal insight and connection to one's true nature form the foundation of healing.

#### Laws, Liberties & Psychedelics: The Future of Policy & Reform

This panel brought together diverse perspectives on psychedelic policy reform. Natalia Rebollo delivered particularly powerful insights, stating that "prohibition is finding new ways of making colonialism prosper" and challenging the scientific establishment's narrow definition of evidence that excludes invaluable indigenous knowledge systems.

"The main problem is that policies aren't being based on science," she noted, arguing that indigenous people "know how to preserve health and nature in a way we don't." She emphasized that healing comes not just from molecules but from "the relationship with the territory."

Tadeusz Hawrot focused on health equity, advocating for access to psychedelic therapies for financially struggling communities with the highest mental health needs. Allison Hoots discussed her work securing legal exemptions for medicine churches in America, while Kasia Malinowska suggested learning from the AIDS movement's very successful advocacy strategies.

Ethan Nadelmann expressed optimism about Scandinavia's evolving attitudes toward psychedelics, pointing out how they are potentially emerging as a global leader in reform. The panel highlighted Peru as a model where the government supports indigenous and traditional healing practices, including ayahuasca usage. 

#### Seven Key Insights from Julian Palmer

Julian Palmer shared wisdom gleaned from 25 years in the field. Among his key points:

1. The mechanisms of psychedelics remain largely unknown, particularly for practices like microdosing, which don’t give you the profound spiritual experience which is generally agreed to be a predictor of healing and transformation.
2. Connection with plant spirits is possible without cultural appropriation.
3. Facilitating psychedelic experiences is emotionally demanding work.
4. Plant spirits are real, though often dismissed by academia—"There's a major prejudice against reality."
5. Molecules aren't consistent or the same as the plant—"DMT isn’t DMT, ibogaine is not iboga," and even synthetic batches can carry different energies. Synthetic substances also possess a form of consciousness, described as "anima" rather than spirit.
6. Both beneficial and challenging entities encountered in psychedelic experiences deserve respectful engagement.
7. Lean in to the discomfort, amplify that which is challenging, and learn how to deal with ‘Bad Things’. 

#### The Psychedelic Renaissance in Europe

This panel explored Europe's growing role in psychedelic medicine. David Erritzoe urged proactive preparation rather than waiting for regulatory changes: "Don't just sit and wait for things to change. You can prepare the system." He advocated for "structural preparation" including certification programs, monitoring systems, and complaint procedures.

Lowan Stewart noted that classical psychedelics and MDMA likely won't receive approval "for some time," suggesting ketamine as an immediate option to develop infrastructure as it’s already legal and regulated. Engilbert Sigurðsson mentioned positive attitudes toward psychedelics in Iceland, while Orla Mallon discussed incorporating peer support models from addiction treatment into psychedelic therapy.

Tadeusz Hawrot introduced the concept of "regulatory sandboxes" where providers can explore treatments not yet fully regulated—an approach potentially relevant to iboga practitioners navigating evolving legal landscapes.

#### From Mind to Market: The Business of Psychedelics

This panel examined ethical challenges in psychedelic commercialization. Simeon Schnapper acknowledged the constant struggle to stay impeccable within a context of for-profit models, noting selective funding approaches to maintain integrity.

Bismark Dadzie advocated for the Bwiti model of constant presence and assistance during ceremonies, while Joel Brierre emphasized that business models don't have to be extractive and purely money focused. He cautioned against dogmatism, saying that anytime we decide there's one right way, we inhibit ourselves from real growth. “Not all the answers are there yet and we’re building the vehicle as we're driving it,” said Bierre, advocating that we keep curiosity and openness at the heart of all we do, and arguing that if we move slowly and collaboratively, we should be able to scale up access to psychedelics effectively and safely.

#### How Psychedelics Can Inspire Climate Action

Marissa Feinberg, founder of Psychedelics for Climate Action, discussed connecting psychedelic and environmental communities. She noted that while climate solutions exist, implementation remains the challenge—suggesting consciousness shifts facilitated by psychedelics might help bridge this gap. 

#### Inside the Mind of the LSD King

In a remarkable conversation, octogenarian Leonard Pickard reflected on his journey from scientist to prisoner to psychedelic elder. After serving 24 years in prison, he shared insights into the creation of LSD in laboratory settings and the spiritual intentionality that guided his work.

Pickard described LSD synthesis as a sacred process conducted with prayers and intention—a framework resonating with traditional approaches to plant medicines. He shared a profound personal experience that reinforced his belief that "we all already have what we seek: ultimate intelligence, compassion, grace."

Now working at Harvard, Pickard expressed his desire to use "new technology to improve human brains" and contribute positively in his remaining years—a testament to the resilience and wisdom that can emerge even through tremendous hardship.

### Performances and Artistic Elements

The conference integrated several artistic performances that complemented the intellectual content:

**To Voice Your Truth:** Arnmundur Björnsson, Guðmundur Óskar, and Óskar Guðjónsson opened Day 2 with a musical and storytelling performance exploring the power of authentic expression. Their message about remaining strong enough to remain vulnerable set a tone of openness for the day.

**Refreshment Break with Arnór Dan:** An atmospheric musical interlude where Arnór's haunting vocals and poetic lyricism created a meditative space for reflection between the day's intensive sessions.

**Final Musical Performance by Steppe Sons:** The conference concluded with Steppe Sons' mesmerizing performance, where traditional Central Asian instruments and rhythmic vocal techniques transported attendees into Kazakhstan's nomadic musical heritage. Their performance created a fitting ceremonial closure to the event, demonstrating how sound and ritual complement the healing practices discussed throughout the conference.

These performances reminded participants that healing traditions worldwide have always integrated art, music, and story with medicine—a principle central to many iboga ceremonies.

### Implications for the Iboga Community

Day 2 of the conference offered several key takeaways for the iboga community:

* Global collaboration is essential: The "Iboga Without Borders" panel demonstrated the value of connecting practitioners across continents while respecting cultural origins. Simon Anderson's call for earnest collaboration could serve as a guiding principle for the community.
* Sustainability must be prioritized: Bismark Dadzie's integration of catfish farming with iboga cultivation offers an inspiring model for sustainable practices that could be adapted elsewhere.
* Research horizons are expanding: Tobias Erny's work on Parkinson's disease suggests iboga's therapeutic potential extends well beyond addiction treatment, opening new research and application pathways.
* Dosage innovations matter: The finding that smaller doses may be more effective for certain conditions mirrors traditional usage patterns and could inform more nuanced therapeutic approaches.
* Policy reform requires indigenous inclusion: Natalia Rebollo's emphasis on including indigenous perspectives in policy development offers a crucial framework as iboga's legal status evolves globally.
* Ethical commercialization remains challenging: The "Mind to Market" panel's discussion of maintaining integrity while scaling access highlights tensions the iboga community must navigate as interest grows.
* Traditional wisdom deserves scientific respect: Throughout the day, speakers emphasized that indigenous knowledge systems contain vital insights that complement rather than contradict scientific understanding.

## Conclusion

The second day of the "Psychedelics as Medicine" conference wove together threads of science, spirituality, policy, and practice into a rich tapestry reflecting the multifaceted nature of psychedelic medicine. For the iboga community specifically, the day offered both validation of traditional approaches and excitement about emerging possibilities.

As these medicines continue gaining recognition worldwide, the conference underscored the importance of bridging knowledge systems—honoring ancestral wisdom while embracing scientific innovation, maintaining ethical foundations while expanding access, and preserving cultural contexts while adapting to diverse healing needs.

The path forward for iboga involves continued dialogue across disciplines, cultures, and perspectives. As Leonard Pickard reminded attendees: "Simple human kindness is vital and so good." Perhaps this simple yet profound insight offers the best compass for navigating the complex terrain ahead—approaching these powerful medicines and each other with reverence, humility, and genuine care.
