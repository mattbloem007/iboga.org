Editor’s note: Jinica Torrez is the author of a remarkable thesis which asks: “How can the plant medicine iboga help to overcome the multidimensional ailments associated with C-PTSD stemming from childhood sexual abuse?” The paper “underscores the potential of iboga to induce profound introspection, dissolve ego boundaries, and foster spiritual insight.” In it, she talks about the challenge of living with CPTSD caused by extreme childhood sexual abuse and explores the almost miraculous healing power of tabernathe iboga. Find the link to her thesis at the end of this story.

Iboga is more than a plant; it is a mirror reflecting the depths of one’s soul. My journey with iboga began as a last resort, a desperate leap toward healing after years of living with the weight of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) stemming from childhood sexual abuse. The path has been transformative, offering profound insights and a sense of wholeness I once thought unattainable. Yet, this journey has taught me that healing with iboga requires immense respect, preparation, and care.

For those unfamiliar, iboga is a psychoactive plant native to Central Africa, used traditionally in Bwiti rituals. Unlike other psychedelics, its effects are more introspective and often deeply challenging. During my first experience, I was struck not by visions but by an intense purging – both physical and emotional. It felt like a release of years of suppressed trauma, clearing space for healing and renewal. Over the course of two ceremonies, I encountered ancestral wisdom, gained clarity about my life’s purpose, and experienced a profound reconnection to my sense of self.

While iboga’s healing potential is immense, it is not without risks. The plant has significant physiological effects, particularly on the heart, making medical screening and supervision non-negotiable. Additionally, the integrity and experience of the facilitator or organisation you choose are crucial. My journey was supported by skilled guides who honoured the medicine’s traditional roots and ensured my physical safety. Without such a foundation, the experience could have been dangerous.

My advice for those who want to iboga is threefold. Firstly, thoroughly research your facilitators. Look for those with verified training and commitment to safety. Make sure they do not have a history of abuse and are trustworthy. Secondly, prioritise your safety. Ensure medical screenings are mandatory and that there is medical oversight available during ceremonies. Finally, the more time you give to preparation before the ceremony and integration after it, the more effective the plant will be. Enter with clear intentions and engage in post-journey therapy or integration practices to ground your experience in lasting change.

Iboga is not a quick fix but a profound tool for those ready to face themselves deeply. It requires courage, preparation, and support. My journey has been life-changing, offering healing for the fractured soul I carried for so long. For those considering this path, approach it with respect and caution, for it holds the power to transform - but only in the right hands.
