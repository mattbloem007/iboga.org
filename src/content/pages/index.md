  section1_paragraph: "What is Iboga? Indigenously, it is the Holy Wood: an agent
    of deep initiation and transformation.  In treatment, its alkaloids are the
    addiction cure which not only interrupts your withdrawals but also helps you
    deal with the roots of your trauma. In medical science, it is one of the few
    compounds discovered which can regenerate the brain, making it potentially
    life saving.  This small shrub from the African rainforest contains within
    its rootbark true magic - not only for healing, but for realignment and
    reconnection of our lives."
