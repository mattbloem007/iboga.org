section1:
  section1_paragraph: What is Iboga?  Indigenously it is the Holy Wood - an agent
    of deep initiation and transformation.  In treatment its alkaloids are the
    addiction cure which not only interrupts your withdrawals but helps you deal
    with the roots of your trauma. In medical science it is one of the few
    compounds discovered which can regenerate the brain - potentially life
    saving.  This small shrub from the African rainforest contains within its
    rootbark true magic - not only for healing but for realignment and
    reconnection of our lives
